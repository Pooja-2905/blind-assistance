The project is designed to assist in object detection and offer auditory feedback to individuals with visual impairments.

Object detection is a complex task in computer vision that encompasses the identification and localization of one or more objects within an image, along with the classification of these objects. This challenge necessitates the accurate localization of objects by drawing bounding boxes around them, as well as correctly identifying the class or category to which each object belongs.
In this notebook, we implement an object detection approach using a pre-trained model known as YOLOv3 with pre-trained weights [yolov3.weights](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights) weighing 237 MB. The model's architecture, referred to as "DarkNet," was originally inspired, albeit loosely, by the VGG-16 model.
